# Functions in Python: Modulo Calculator

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that defines a function which accepts two values and returns their **modulo** using the `%` operator.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a function called `result` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`.
2. Inside the function, compute the modulo using `a % b`.
3. Print the result of the modulo operation.
4. Get two integer inputs from the user.
5. Call the `result` function with the user-provided values.

## 🧾 Program
```
def result(a,b):     # Defining a function

    c = a % b        # taking ,modulus of a to b

    print(c)         # to print c

a = int(input())     # getting a input-1 from user

b = int(input())     # getting a input-2 from user

result(a,b)          # calling a function result with parameters a & b
```
