# 🔺 Looping(Patterns)-Pascal's Triangle Generator in Python

This project demonstrates a simple Python program to generate **Pascal’s Triangle**, where the number of rows is provided by the user.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To write a Python program that generates **Pascal's Triangle** using numbers. The number of rows is accepted from the user.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Input the number of rows from the user.
3. Loop from 0 to the number of rows.
4. For each row:
   - Print appropriate spaces to shape the triangle.
   - Compute values using the formula:  
     \[
     C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
     \]
5. Print all rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
6. End the program.

## 🧪 Program
```
def print_pascals_triangle_formula(num_rows):

    for n in range(num_rows):
        val = 1
        row_list = []
        for k in range(n + 1):
             row_list.append(str(val))
             val = val * (n - k) // (k + 1)
    
         row_str = " ".join(row_list)
         max_width = len(" ".join(map(str, [1] * num_rows)))
         print(row_str.center(max_width))

n = int(input())
print_pascals_triangle_formula(n)
```
